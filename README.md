=========

Private repository for client(s) and server for card games, initially poker and its style variants.

Overview
--------

Develop a card game server and a variety of clients, with an emphasis on poker but the flexibility for any card game. Repurpose to any non-card game is a stretch goal.

This project, in its current phase, is an experiment in client/server development. It exists primarily as an exercise to reacquaint with current trends in client/server development, as well as a forced and quick deep dive into game development.

Components
----------

Card Game Server
Card Game Web Client
Card Game iOS Client
Card Game Android Client
